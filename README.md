## Synchronous JavaScript:

1. Code executes sequentially, one line at a time.
2. Each statement waits for the previous statement to complete.
3. Blocking: subsequent code execution is halted until the current task finishes.

Example:

```
console.log("Start");
alert("Hello");
console.log("End");
```

### Asynchronous JavaScript:

1. Code executes concurrently, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously.
2. Non-blocking: subsequent code execution continues without waiting.
3. Uses callbacks, promises, or async/await.

Example (using setTimeout):

```
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Async task completed");
}, 2000);
console.log("End");
```

### This Keyword

`this `refers to the current execution context of a function. Its value changes depending on how the function is called.

- Regular Functions

In regular functions, this behaves differently based on the calling context:

1. Global Context: this points to the global object.
   console.log(this);
1. Function Call: this points to the global object.

```
function foo() {
console.log(this);
}
foo();
```

1. Method Call: this points to the object that owns the method.

```
const obj = {
foo: function() {
console.log(this); // obj
}
};
obj.foo();
```

1. Constructor Call: this points to the newly created object.

```
function Person(name) {
this.name = name;
console.log(this); // Person object
}
const person = new Person('John');
```

### Arrow Functions

In arrow functions, this behaves differently:

1. Lexical Binding: this inherits the context from the surrounding scope.
```
const obj = {
foo: () => {
console.log(this); // window (browser) or global (Node.js)
}
};
obj.foo();
```
1. No Constructor: Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors.
```
const Person = (name) => {
this.name = name;
};
```
